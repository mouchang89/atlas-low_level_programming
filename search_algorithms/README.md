In this project, I learned what search algorithm, linear search, and binary search are. I also learned the best search algorithm to use depending on what is needed.

This is the format I have to use regarding big O notations.

    O(1)
    O(n)
    O(n!)
    n*m -> O(nm)
    n square -> O(n^2)
    sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
    log(n) -> O(log(n))
    n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
